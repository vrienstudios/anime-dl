# Goal Of This Port

The goal of this port is to greatly increase code readability, modularity, and increase ease of use.

The main backing library will be made public eventually for usage by others.

An experimental release will be released within the next weeks.

# Usage:
It should be self explanatory, if you use the UI by simply executing the executable.

Here's the general flags for the CLI invocation.

<h6>
<ul>
    <li>-e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Export (only effects text based modules)</li>
    <li>"uri"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Downloads from uri</li>
    <li>"term"&nbsp;| Searches for valid term, if object within quotes is not an uri</li>
</ul>
